## Part 1: DAP Design and Implementation

## Introduction

This project outlines the design and implementation of a Data Analytics Pipeline (DAP) to process, analyze, and visualize the 3-1-1 inquiry volume data from the City of Vancouver. The goal of this pipeline is to address key analytical questions related to inquiry trends and departmental performance, utilizing AWS cloud services for data storage, preparation, and analysis.

The pipeline covers multiple stages, starting from data discovery and storage design, to cleaning, structuring, and analysis of the data using AWS services like S3, DataBrew, Glue, and Athena. The final outputs include structured data ready for analysis and visualizations that provide insights into the inquiry patterns over time.

### Key Objectives
1. Formulating analytical questions to guide the inquiry.
2. Leveraging cloud-based infrastructure for scalable data storage and processing.
3. Automating data cleaning and transformation workflows.
4. Performing data analysis to uncover insights about inquiry volumes.
5. Delivering visualizations and reports for stakeholder use.

This project demonstrates the integration of cloud-based tools and data analytics best practices to ensure efficient processing and insightful analysis.
